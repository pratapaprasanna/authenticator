## UseCase
- Any idea or application a developer wants to develop. He has to put-in efforts to develop an authenticator using which a user signs up to the app. 
- Authenticator is just that component which adds user to a db and validates if any request is coming from a person belonging to the application.

In signup you have multiple ways of doing it
- Manual sign-up {where you enter first name, lastname, email etc.}
- Signup with google/facebook/twitter

## Architecture or Idea

We want to go on a micro-frameworks architecture for easy plugin facility.

Some other day we want to work on some idea we should be able to use this authenticator to add users.

### Setup Requisites
 - Mongo
 - docker

 - Kubernetes (Soon once the working prototype is ready)

### ENV setup

Post this start making changes to the code they should be reflected and you should be able to see them running.

### Current-state: 
In the repo you see signup with google until now. Moving forward we should add the ability to signup with facebook/twitter

## User Journey
